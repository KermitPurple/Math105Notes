# Math 105 Notes

PDFs stored for Professor Ho's Math 105 class for Fall 2022.
Additionally, there is a script to generate an index page for it.

This script expects PDFs to be stored as `pdfs/yymmddtitle.pdf`.
For example: `pdfs/220807Numbers and stuff and things.pdf`.
There is a date in the begining so there can be an order given to the documents.
The first two characters represent the year and the next two characters represent the month and the next ones represent the day.

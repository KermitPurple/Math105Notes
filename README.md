# Math 105 Notes

PDFs stored for Professor Ho's Math 105 class for Fall 2022.
Additionally, there is a script to generate an index page for it.

This script expects PDFs to be stored as `pdfs/##title.pdf`.
For example: `pdfs/03Numbers and stuff and things.pdf`.
There is a number in the begining so there can be an order given to the documents.
